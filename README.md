Project title: Forecasting Car Park Electric Vehicles Charging Station Upgrades by Region

This project predicts regional electric vehicle (EV) charging station upgrade needs in Singapore by analyzing car park availability and NO₂ emissions using machine learning.

- Data Integration: Collect various datasets from data.gov.sg. Then, combine the datasets, car park availability, geospatial data, and NO₂ pollutant levels, and use the combined and cleaned dataset to analyze regional trends.
- Feature Engineering: Process and normalize data, including calculating hourly differences in car park availability and mapping car parks to regions.
- Machine Learning: Train and test various models, compare the performance, with the Ensemble model selected eventually for its accuracy in predicting NO₂ levels.
- Use Case: Identify high-emission regions to prioritize EV charging station upgrades, supporting Singapore's shift to sustainable mobility.

## Introduction to Internet of Things

Module code: CS3237

This project focuses on designing and building a complete IoT system, incorporating both hardware and software components to address real-world challenges.

- Sensor Integration: Utilize hardware sensors to collect real-time data such as temperature and gas level.
- Microcontroller Programming: Configure and program microcontrollers (ESP32) for data acquisition and wireless communication.
- Frontend Interface: Design a user-friendly web interface to display sensor data and control connected devices remotely.
- Actuation: Trigger actuators (sprinkler) based on sensor data or user commands.
